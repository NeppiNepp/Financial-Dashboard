I started this project because manually tracking bank accounts & transactions can be more helpful for understanding how much is going in & out of your accounts. The plan is also to add more customizability to the UI for users to change the look of their dashboard. Many people these days like to be able to customize apps to suit their needs and look how they want, which most apps don't really provide. Most financial dashboards apps use things like Plaid to add/verify accounts. I wanted a dashboard that allows users to add information based on what they use since apps like Plaid don't cover every bank out there, meaning sometimes users can't even use the dashboard they are trying to use. This app is still heavily in progress, with some examples of things to be added are stocks (either retrieved from third party apps or manually entered), bills/subscriptions that will be on their own page and connected to accounts (currently in progress), and a main dashboard showing simplified information of each page with total balances."),

On the accounts page you can add either a credit, checking, or savings account by clicking the + button and filling out information depending on the account type chosen. You can manually add transactions for each account. For example, a checking account can have withdrawals & transactions added which will automatically increase/decrease the current balance. Each transaction added will be visible on the Transactions page, while the 3 newest transactions added will be visible on the Accounts page in the bank account."),

The backend is managed by a Cloud Firestore database. Authentication is done by comparing the login details entered with the login details stored in the database. Once that is verified, the information stored in a seperate collection is retrieved. Originally I planned to use Firebase's email & password authentication, but I decided to use this other method since it didn't work well with how I stored user information. This authentication method may change in the future if it is not very scalable. Currently the information in the database for each user is stored in an Accounts collection with individual info being stored in seperate documents within.")));
